# Comp-271-Project
This was my first real coding project created during my freshman year of college. I was taking an introductory Computer Science Course where we learned Java and for our final we were given the option to propose our own project, so I chose to code a simple card game with influence from games like Yugioh and Hearthstone.

The following semester I had used the original code and added a few upgrades (spell cards, graveyard, etc.)
